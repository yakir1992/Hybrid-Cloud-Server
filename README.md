# **Hybrid Cloud Networking Setup**

This repository automates the deployment of a sophisticated hybrid cloud networking architecture using **Terraform**, integrating various AWS services for robust connectivity, redundancy, security, and efficient network management.

## Technologies Used

- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code tool for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure.
- **AWS Direct Connect**: Dedicated network connection between on-premises data centers and AWS.
- **AWS Transit Gateway**: Centralized hub for connecting multiple VPCs and on-premises networks.
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: Secure backup connection for remote access and redundancy.
- **AWS Route 53**: DNS web service for managing domain names and routing traffic.
- **AWS Network Firewall**: Managed firewall service for filtering and monitoring network traffic.

## Benefits

- **Automation**: Infrastructure provisioning and updates are automated using Terraform, ensuring consistency and reducing human error.
- **Scalability**: AWS services like Direct Connect and Transit Gateway support scalable and flexible network architecture.
- **Security**: VPN and AWS Network Firewall provide secure remote access and robust network security policies.
- **High Availability**: Redundant connections via Direct Connect and VPN enhance availability and fault tolerance.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimal utilization of AWS resources and efficient data transfer strategies.

## Repository Structure

- **main.tf**: Terraform configuration file defining AWS resources including Direct Connect, Transit Gateway, VPN, Route 53 settings, and Network Firewall rules.
- **variables.tf**: Declaration of input variables such as Direct Connect parameters, VPN settings, and firewall rules.
- **outputs.tf**: Output definitions for Terraform to display after deployment, such as VPN connection details and Route 53 configurations.
- **README.md**: Documentation providing an overview of the repository, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Customize variables in `variables.tf` to match your specific networking requirements.
3. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
4. Execute `terraform plan` to preview the infrastructure changes.
5. Apply the changes using `terraform apply` to deploy the hybrid cloud networking setup.

## Contributions

Contributions to enhance automation, add new features, or improve documentation are welcome. Please follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the repository.

This setup ensures a robust, scalable, and secure hybrid cloud networking environment using modern cloud infrastructure practices.
